# Quantum Computing Workgroup 
Repository of the Quantum Computing Workgroup, 2023.

# Introduction
# Structure
+ Chat-Based Group: A localized group where you can always ask questions and work through problems. We can work together to help each other through the learning process. (Meetings not necessary)
+ Book Club: We choose a book and have set chapters every week/month/etc. that we will read and then discuss during a meeting.
+ Lecture (Richard Feynman Technique): Based on what we have been recently studying, we teach the rest of the group the concept. (The best way to truly learn is to teach)
+ Paper Review: We meet to discuss an agreed-upon paper.
+ Q&A: Everyone shares questions about what they are currently learning. The rest of the group can answer/work through the problem. (Meeting or text chat-based)
